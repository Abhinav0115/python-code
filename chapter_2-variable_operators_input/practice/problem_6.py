# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user. 

a = int(input("Enter a number: "))

b = a * a

print("Square of the entered number ", a, " is: ", b)

print("Square of the entered number ", a, " is: ", a**2) # a^2 is not the correct syntax for square in python. Correct syntax is a**2
